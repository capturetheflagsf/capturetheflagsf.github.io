     <!-- Rules -->
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each team has a side. In this case, the sides are split between "Above Ground" and "Below Ground". When on your side, you are safe. If you cross over the line to the other team's side and get tug by an opposing team member, you must go to jail.</li>
      <li>The <strong>goal</strong> of the game is to get the other team's flag and bring it back to your side without getting caught. If your team successuflly captures the flag, the game is over!
      <li><strong>Jail:</strong> when you get tug, you must walk directly to jail, you cannot take a roundabout way and you cannot snoop around. The person that tags you can either choose to escort you to jail to limit what you see along the way OR let you walk on your own. Jail locations will be determined at the beginning of each game, either designated by the team if the flag is hidden, or at an agreed upon location if the flag is at a designated location. </li>
      <li><strong>Hiding the flag:</strong>
      	<ul>
      		<li><strong>Designated Location:</strong> In this variant both teams know the location of the other team's flag. The challange is to get to the flag and get 
            <li><strong>Hidden Location:</strong> In this variant, both teams choose a location to hide their flag. Neither team knows the location of the other team's flag at the start of the game. Prior to capturing the flag, the flag must first be found. In this variant, the following guidelines must be followed for hiding the flag:
            <ul>
            	<li>at least 50% of the flag must be visible</li>
                <li>the flag must be visible from at least 3 sides (including top and bottom)</li>
                <li>at least one of the visible sides must be from a main pathway</li>
            </ul>
       	</ul>
      <li><strong>Capturing the flag:</strong> If you find the flag, you must grab it and run with it back to your side. If during your journey back to your side, you get tug, you give the flag back to the person that tug you and go to jail. The person that tug you, must then immediatly take the flag back to the original hiding spot. The flag cannot be re-hidden at a new location.</li>
    </ul>
